# GrimAC Fork

**Link to Grim: https://github.com/MWHunter/Grim**

This is my fork of Grim, an advanced anticheat for Minecraft.

I don't want to intrude upon Grim's vision, so I created my own.

**New Checks (as of 6/27/22):** 
- AimAssist (x1)
- AutoBlock (x1)
- AutoHeal (x6)
- Inventory (x5)
- BadPackets (x5)
- PacketOrder (x5)
- PingSpoof (x11)

Feel free to try it out for yourself.

Note that this fork is way less configurable, as 99% of checks instantly kick the player.
