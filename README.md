# Grim Fork

**Link to Grim: https://github.com/MWHunter/Grim**


This is my fork of Grim, an advanced anticheat for Minecraft.

I don't want to intrude upon Grim's vision, so I created my own.


**New Checks (as of 6/27/22):** 
- AimAssist (x4)
- AutoBlock (x1)
- AutoHeal (x7)
- Inventory (x10)
- BadPackets (x10)
- PacketOrder (x4)
- PingSpoof (x11)
- Scaffold (x1)

Feel free to try it out for yourself.

Note that this fork is way less configurable, as 99% of checks instantly kick the player.
